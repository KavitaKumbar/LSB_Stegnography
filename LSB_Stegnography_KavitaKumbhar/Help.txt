Project LSB Stegnography

1: The application accepts an image file say .bmp along with a text file that contains the message to be steged
2: Analyze the size of the message file to check whether the message could fit in the provided .bmp image
   Provide an option to steg a magic string which could be useful to identify whether the image is steged or not
3: The application should provide an option to decrypt the file
4: This has to be a command-line application and all the options have to be passed as a command-line argument
